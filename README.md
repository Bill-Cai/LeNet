# LeNet PyTorch Implementation

## Introduction

This is a PyTorch implementation of the LeNet architecture. The LeNet architecture was first introduced by Yann LeCun in 1998. It was designed to classify handwritten digits. The architecture consists of 7 layers, including 3 convolutional layers and 2 fully connected layers. The architecture is as follows:
